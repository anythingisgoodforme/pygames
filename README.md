# Mountain Bike Platformer Demo

Simple Pygame demo where you control a mountain bike jumping over generated hills.

Controls:
- Right arrow: accelerate forward
- Left arrow: accelerate backward
- Up arrow: jump (when on ground)

Run:

```bash
python3 mountain_bike.py
```

Install dependencies first, for example in a virtualenv:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This is a minimal demo intended as a starting point. Improve by adding art, sound, and better physics.
